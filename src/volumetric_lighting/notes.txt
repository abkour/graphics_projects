Intuition:

The question we are trying to answer is:
What fragments are illuminated by the light source?
This question implicitly assumes that the light source has already illuminated the scene.
To achieve this we use a shadow map. 
To determine which fragments are illuminated by the light source, we need to determine if 
the fragment is within the volume encapsulated by the light source (we assume directional lighting).

One way we can achieve that is by performing a ray trace from the fragment to the light source. 
The problem with this approach is that we require information about the objects in the scene, 
which is not suited for fragment shaders.
